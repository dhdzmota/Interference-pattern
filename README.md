# Interference pattern

An interference pattern can be achieved when two waves of similar frequencies intersect. This can be generated in quantum physics with the intersection of two wave functions that describe the position of an electron, rendering the famous interpretation of a wave/particle duality. This is the principle that is shown in the double slit experiment, where two wave functions interact with each another and generates a new renormalized wavefunction. This can be easily simulated by implementing the solution of a quantum system and slighty variating some of the parameters.
